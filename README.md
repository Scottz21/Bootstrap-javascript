Project title: Recreate Your Favorite Website Using Bootstrap and JavaScript

Project description: This project is a simplified recreation of a website built using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. The goal is to practice responsive layouts and component-based design while gaining hands-on experience with Bootstrap's grid system and UI elements.
The project focuses on structuring and styling the site using  HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. In Part 2, I create JavaScript functions that simulate future interactive features. These functions are not integrated into the UI .
Installation: To run this project locally, follow these steps:
1.	Clone the repository
Open your terminal and run:
git clone https://github.com/Scottz21/Bootstrap-javascript.git
2.	Navigate into the project folder
3.	Open the project in your browser
You can simply open the index.html file with your preferred web browser:
o	Double-click index.html, or
o	Use a Live Server extension (if you're using VS Code)
No installation of dependencies is required since this project uses CDN links for Bootstrap and pure JavaScript.
Usage:
Once the project is open in your browser:
•	Explore the layout and components recreated using Bootstrap.
•	Resize the browser window to see how the design adapts responsively.
•	Review the JavaScript code in the console or script file to see how future features are being simulated using:
o	Functions
o	Variables
o	Arrays
o	String manipulation
Note: The JavaScript features are not connected to the UI — they’re written as standalone functions to demonstrate future functionality ideas.
This project is ideal for practicing front-end skills and understanding the structure behind more complex websites.
Features:
 Responsive design using Bootstrap’s grid system and components
Recreated layout based on a real-world website for design practice
Clean and modern user interface built with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap
JavaScript functions written to simulate potential future site features
Practice with key JavaScript concepts
